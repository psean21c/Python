# Python Comprehension Problems

Problem 1: myFilter(L, num)

```python
input: list of numbers and a number.
output: list of numbers not containing a multiple of num.
example: given list = [1,2,4,5,7] and num = 2, return [1,5,7].
```

Problem 2: myLists(L)
```python
input: list L of non-negative integers.
output: a list of lists: for every element x in L create a list containing 1; 2; : : : ; x.
example: given [1,2,4] return [[1],[1,2],[1,2,3,4]].
```


Problem 3: myFunctionComposition(f,g)
```python
input: two functions f and g, represented as dictionaries, such that g  f exists.
output: dictionary that represents a function g  f.
example: given f = f0:'a'; 1:'b'g and g = f'a':'apple'; 'b':'banana'g, return f0:'apple'; 1:'banana'g.
```



Problem 4: Each of the following asks for the sum of two complex numbers. For each, nd the solution.
```python
a. (3 + 1 i) + (2 + 2 i)
b. (ô€€€1 + 2 i) + (1 ô€€€ 1 i)
c. (2 + 0 i) + (ô€€€3 + 0.001 i)
d. 4(0 + 2 i) + (0.001 + 1 i)
```

Problem 5: For each of the following, calculate the answer over GF(2).
```python
a. 1 + 1 + 1 + 0
b. 1 . 1 + 0 . 1 + 0 . 0 + 1 . 1
c. (1 + 1 + 1) . (1 + 1 + 1 + 1)
```


Problem 6: mySum(L)
```python
Input: list of numbers
Output: sum of numbers in the list
```


Problem 7: myProduct(L)
```python
Input: list of numbers
Output: product of numbers in the list
```


Problem 8: myMin(L)
```python
Input: list of numbers
Output: minimum number in the list
```


Problem 9: myConcat(L)
```python
Input: list of strings
Output: concatenation of all the strings in L
```


Problem 10: myUnion(L)
```python
Input: list of sets
Output: the union of all sets in L.
```
